### Advice from an Old Programmer:
- 💟 'What I discovered after this journey of learning is that it’s not the languages that matter but what you do with them.'
- 💟 'Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.'
* 💟 'Code goes both ways.'
* 💟 'You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.'
* 💟 'People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. 
   People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected 
   and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.'
* 💟 '... I’ll say that learning to create software changes you and makes you different. Not better or worse, just different.'
* 💟 'You can code. ... That is pretty damn cool.' 


#### ESCAPE SEQUENCES

> This is all of the escape sequences Python supports. You may not use many of these, but memorize their format and what they do anyway. Try them out in some strings to see if you can make them work.
